## Requirements

* Python 3.8+ (Native support for Apple Silicon) 

* tensorflow-macos 2.0+ (for macOS)

```
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
python -m pip install tensorflow-macos
```

* OpenAI Gym 

`pip install 'gym[all]'`
* opencv-python 

`pip install opencv-python`

tensorflow 2.0+ is initially running on CPU, tensorflow-gpu and tensorflow-metal is also supportedã€‚

`python -m pip install tensorflow-metal`

## Installation
